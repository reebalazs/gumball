What It Is and Is Not
=====================

Is
==

- People, Operations, Platform.  In that order.

- Hosted cloud for Pyramid applications, multiple providers.

- Documented, reproducible, convenient, reliable deployment of Pyramid
  apps at scale with supported machinery.

- Operations, testing, monitoring, development, project management,
  ticketing, help desk, etc. available from multiple sources under
  standing agreements

- A platform for developers to build custom, content-oriented products

- A series of independent packages with few framework contracts beyond
  Pyramid, thus giving "batteries included"

- An opinionated set of choices with little interest in pluggability

- Modest level of plugin-points

- Focused on deployment of a particular hosting pattern at a controlled
  set of hosting vendors

- Scratching different itches than Plone's sweet spot

- An admin UI with a pleasing out-of-the-box UX

Is Not
======

- A product for end-users

- An overall framework imposing a heavy set of conventions

- A mix-and-match set of swappable components

- Burdened with pluggability at every turn before you even need to
  have a plug

- Likewise, not components-everywhere-you-turn

- A content management system for publishing brochures to huge
  public sites

- For sophisticated document management with records archival

- For portals and integration

- Enterprise-y
