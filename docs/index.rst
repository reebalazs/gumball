Gumball
=======

Pyramid is a clean slate with no opinions about UX (user experience)
choices, frameworks, or technologies.  Which is ideal: many other
systems presume too much and you spend most of your time fighting the
framework.  But what if you want a known starting point,
a set of UX choices shared across maintained projects with a community
behind these choices?

Gumball is just that and no more: a set of choices about technologies,
styles, and conventions on how to build a custom UX for your project.
Gumball isn't an application, beyond a sample Pyramid app.  It isn't
framework-y in a significant way, nor is it "pluggable" beyond its own
set of choices.
