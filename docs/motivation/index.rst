==================
Gumball Motivation
==================

The people involved in Gumball have been working together (commercially
 and otherwise) on a number of Pyramid projects:

- KARL, a large open source knowledge management system atop Pyramid

- A commercial application atop Pyramid

- A general purpose admin tool for Pyramid

Each of these need their own UX. But each share some code and establish
some conventions.  We began to think about making some space we could
consolidate the common stuff.

In particular, the KARL project commissioned an overhaul of its
5-year-old UX.  The process of incepting a new UX meant thinking about
every pixel, laying down some opinions, and mocking things up.

This set of documents is that process.  The word KARL occasionally pops
 up, but the thought process is intended to be general.
