- The balance between the upside of setting some conventions and the
  downside of foisting yet another abstraction

- Making users of Gumball do the BeforeRender subscriber to add the
  renderer globals is a bit of a drag

- Is the inject_static a good idea? The thinking is: Gumball knows all
  the static URL paths it needs. Deform makes the user of Deform register
   all of that and get it right. Should be the package's responibility.

- em or px?

- Should better looking Deform widgets go in Deform or here?
