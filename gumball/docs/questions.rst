- Making users of Gumball do the BeforeRender subscriber to add the
  renderer globals is a bit of a drag

- Is the inject_static a good idea? The thinking is: Gumball knows all
  the static URL paths it needs. Deform makes the user of Deform register
   all of that and get it right. Should be the package's responibility.

- em or px?
