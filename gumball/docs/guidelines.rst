==================
Gumball Guidelines
==================

Laundry list of best practices, styles, decisions, whatever.

- static is for static, don't need subdirs for css, images, js.

- Common top-level names and identifiers

- Eliminate the main_template.macros['main'] madness

- Handle the precedence of what is loaded, when

- Decide on whether jslib stuff is loaded just before closing body

- Emphasize far-future expires with versioned URLs on static stuff
